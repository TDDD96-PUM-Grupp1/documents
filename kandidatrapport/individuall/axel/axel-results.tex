\section{Resultat}
\label{sec:axel-results}

This section presents the results. Note that the results are presented
factually, striving for objectivity as far as possible.  The results
shall not be analyzed, discussed or evaluated.  This is left for the
discussion section.

In case the method section has been divided into subheadings such as
pre-study, implementation and evaluation, the result section should
have the same sub-headings. This gives a clear structure and makes the
section easier to write.

In case results are presented from a process (e.g. an implementation
process), the main decisions made during the process must be clearly
presented and justified. Normally, alternative attempts, etc, have
already been described in the theory section, making it possible to
refer to it as part of the justification.

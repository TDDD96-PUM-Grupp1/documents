\section{Slutsatser}
\label{sec:axel-conclusion}

This chapter contains a summarization of the purpose and the research
questions. To what extent has the aim been achieved, and what are the
answers to the research questions?

The consequences for the target audience (and possibly for researchers
and practitioners) must also be described. There should be a section
on future work where ideas for continued work are described. If the
conclusion chapter contains such a section, the ideas described
therein must be concrete and well thought through.
